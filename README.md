# source
This ruby gem is an old and minimal implementation of the [source engine RCON](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol)

I'm not sure if this still works at this point (October 20th, 2018) but if you're using it and it works, I suggest looking for a better alternative. If you find an alternative or there's a lack a of a better option, please contact me, as I would like to pass the name of this gem to something more suitable!

## I want the gem name
If you want the gem name I completely understand - it's a very generic and useful name.

I will provide you the gem name for free if your purpose is relevant to the name, but please understand that because there might be some users of this gem, I will never give you explicit ownership for security reasons.

## License
This is dual-licensed as WTFPL and MIT.

This means that you can decide between the WTFPL license (equivalent to the work being released in the public domain if your country/state allows it) - or the MIT license.
